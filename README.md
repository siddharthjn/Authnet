Authnet follows 2 step verification system to provide access to your space

2nd Slide:

2-Step Verification: 
So what is two step verification? I guess most of you would already have enabled it for facebook and google. You enter your password, Facebook sends you a unique verification system in no time. This verification code provides you an extra layer of security.
I use it all the time to login to my facebook and google account

3rd Slide:
Why 2-step verification?
Well, passwords can be hacked. You don’t need to have a strong hacking background to hack in to someone’s account. Statistics reveal most of the passwords are hacked by social engineering

4th Slide
We are surprised this feature is not being used for Home Security. Who needs keys anyways? I keep losing them all the time.
But then there are mobile devices which I love my phone more than my life. It  would make my life a lot easier me to enter my password on a number pad, instantly get a verification code via text message , enter the code again on netduino  and I am able to enter my apartment.



5th Slide :
No Low cost affordable solution is available in the market. Yes there are intercom solutions where you can dial in and enter building. But to enter your own apartment we are still pretty much dependent on keys and locks.



AuthNet – Your Savior!

AuthNet addresses this issue. It is affordable, easy to setup & completely secure.
A netduino board costs around 50$. This amount is enough for you to :

 (i) Enter  apartment without a key
(ii) Provide access to your friends from anywhere in the world. Not even the expensive bulky intercoms can do that.
(iii) Forget about losing keys
(iv) See logs of when the apartment was accessed

Who will use it?
1>	People like you and me

However Authnet is designed to have minimum server maintenance cost & its smart architecture is capable to meet the needs of
2>	Apartment buildings
3>	Enterprises who need secure workplace(Who doesn’t need a secure workplace)

How does it Work?

The user enters the code on the numpad. The Neduino sends this information to the Node server which would then text you back a verification code on your phone number using Twilio
